# readme-generator-App
Developers develop applications very frequently and each appliaction requires a readme file which will describe the application, how it was developed, technologies used, linkes to the deployed site and how users can use it or other developers can contribute to it. To this effect, having an automatic readme generator will help the developer save enough time in focusing on the development process rather than taking time to write the readme.  

This is a command line application which gets input from the user by asking important questions about the developed application such as title, description, table of content, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests instructions, license type, github repos, email and generates a readme file with links to the deployed application and repository.
